# Dar Tahara Automated Assistant

The website chat and WhatsApp integration use the same server-side engine in `src/lib/assistant`. Future mobile and hospitality channels should call `answerAssistant` rather than implementing their own detection, retrieval, or escalation rules.

For the production WhatsApp webhook, queue, FreeScout and deployment runbook, see `docs/WHATSAPP_SUPPORT.md`.

## Root cause of the old fallback

The previous assistant used a shallow exact-token retrieval pass. When no entry scored highly enough, deterministic composition selected a generic specialist fallback. The static handoff article also explicitly treated missing knowledge and low confidence as reasons to escalate, reinforcing the behavior for model-generated answers. Foreign-language wording, spelling mistakes and follow-up questions therefore missed English source terms more often. The problem was retrieval and decision policy, not a token/context limit.

## Answering workflow

Each turn now performs the following shared flow:

1. Resolve language using an explicit UI selection first, then the latest confidently detected customer message, then stored conversation/browser language.
2. Classify the current intent with recent history for short follow-ups.
3. Normalize common spelling mistakes and create synonym/semantic retrieval rewrites.
4. Search published Supabase knowledge and version-controlled approved knowledge across those rewrites.
5. Filter out non-public, unapproved and obsolete versions, rank the results, and retain source IDs.
6. Use deterministic tools for authoritative calculations such as pricing.
7. Answer directly from one approved source (`confirmed`) or compatible sources (`derived`).
8. Ask one concise question when customer-specific information is missing (`needs_customer_clarification`).
9. Record an internal gap when Dar Tahara has not approved a policy (`missing_business_knowledge`).
10. Create a human handoff only for a real staff operation (`requires_human_action`).

The configured model receives original, untranslated history and a separate `Current conversation language` instruction. It may translate approved facts into that language, but cannot add prices, policies, cities, availability, guarantees, discounts, legal conclusions or service inclusions.

## Language behavior

Supported languages are English, Dutch, French, Spanish, German, Portuguese and Arabic, including deterministic Moroccan Darija signals. Short greetings are handled before statistical detection. The threshold is greater than 80%; a low-confidence first message produces a multilingual language-choice question.

Language priority is:

1. explicitly selected language;
2. latest confidently detected customer message;
3. stored conversation language;
4. browser/account language;
5. default locale.

This lets a customer switch naturally by writing in another supported language and also recognizes requests such as “Can we continue in English?”. Main answers, clarification, suggestions, errors, handoff copy and feedback controls use the active language. Names, addresses, booking/invoice IDs, URLs, email addresses, phone numbers, units, dates and prices are not translated.

## Retrieval and grounding

`src/lib/assistant/reasoning-provider.ts` provides deterministic query correction and synonym expansion, with optional Grok rewrites. `src/lib/assistant/service.ts` searches original and rewritten queries, related intent categories, localized static knowledge and published `knowledge_entries`. The migration adds a GIN-indexed full-text document. Approved English knowledge remains valid source material for a non-English response.

The provider is never called as a business-truth source. If no approved facts or deterministic tool result exist, the assistant records a gap and gives a specific missing-policy response instead of invoking a model to guess.

## Escalation rules

Human support is triggered only for:

- an explicit request for a person;
- changing or cancelling a confirmed booking;
- a possibly charged failed payment, duplicate charge, refund request or invoice dispute requiring records;
- reported theft, missing property, damage, injury, serious safety/security conditions or staff misconduct;
- an active property-access failure, lost physical key or active digital-lock malfunction;
- staff no-show;
- terminating an existing contract/subscription;
- account-specific information requiring authentication or internal records;
- an operational exception/approval;
- a repeated unresolved technical failure;
- an unresolved unknown request after multiple clarification attempts.

General questions containing words such as “damage”, “lost key”, “refund” or “unsafe” are not treated as incidents when they are clearly hypothetical or policy questions.

## Knowledge Builder

Administrators open `/admin/assistant` and select **Knowledge Builder**. It shows a manageable prioritized queue, unanswered-question frequency, handoffs, clarification/self-service counts, low-confidence answers, outdated entries and coverage by category.

Workflow states are `draft_question`, `awaiting_owner_answer`, `owner_answered`, `needs_clarification`, `pending_approval`, `approved`, `rejected`, `superseded` and `archived`.

Saving an owner answer creates a pending-review draft only. **Approve and publish** calls the atomic `approve_knowledge_builder_question` database function, which creates/updates the article, appends a version, publishes one retrieval entry, resolves linked gaps and writes an audit event in one transaction. A partial failure rolls back the whole approval. Draft, rejected, superseded and archived content is never queried as customer-facing truth.

Unanswered customer text is privacy-redacted, fingerprinted, clustered, counted and linked to an owner question. Email, phone, booking reference, address, URL and access-code data are masked before optional reasoning calls.

## Optional Grok integration

Grok is disabled by default. Configure only server-side:

```env
GROK_ENABLED=false
GROK_API_KEY=
GROK_MODEL=
GROK_TIMEOUT_MS=6000
GROK_MAX_TOKENS=350
GROK_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=20
```

When enabled, Grok may rewrite retrieval queries, draft clarifications/suggestions and summarize supplied approved text. The provider has bounded tokens, timeouts, retries, per-minute limiting, a circuit breaker, privacy redaction and deterministic fallback. It may never define Dar Tahara business facts. Provider telemetry records operation, model, success, latency, token counts and failure code without prompts or customer content.

## Database and APIs

Migration: `supabase/migrations/20260716151742_assistant_knowledge_builder.sql`.

New/extended storage:

- `knowledge_builder_questions` — owner interview and approval queue;
- `assistant_knowledge_gaps` — clustered unanswered questions;
- `assistant_provider_events` — privacy-safe provider cost/failure telemetry;
- `knowledge_articles` / `knowledge_article_versions` — canonical metadata and immutable versions;
- `knowledge_entries` — published retrieval records with keywords, synonyms, scope and full-text search;
- `assistant_feedback` — helpful/unhelpful customer feedback (existing table, new API/UI use).

Routes:

- `POST /api/assistant/chat` — shared website assistant;
- `POST /api/assistant/feedback` — session-bound answer feedback;
- `GET|POST /api/admin/assistant/knowledge` — administrator Knowledge Builder;
- `POST /api/jobs/assistant` — authenticated telemetry retention cleanup.

All Knowledge Builder, gap and provider-event tables have RLS enabled and no anonymous/authenticated grants. The app accesses them with the server-only service role through protected routes.

## Environment and retention

Besides the standard assistant/provider variables in `.env.example`, configure:

```env
ASSISTANT_KNOWLEDGE_GAP_RETENTION_DAYS=365
ASSISTANT_PROVIDER_EVENT_RETENTION_DAYS=90
ASSISTANT_JOB_SECRET=
CRON_SECRET=
```

`vercel.json` schedules `GET /api/jobs/assistant` daily. Vercel supplies `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET`; external schedulers may instead call `POST` with `ASSISTANT_JOB_SECRET`. The database validates positive retention periods and deletes expired gap samples and provider telemetry.

## Deployment

1. Back up the database.
2. Apply `20260716151742_assistant_knowledge_builder.sql` in staging.
3. Configure the Supabase service role and optional provider settings server-side.
4. Run `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run check:i18n` and `npm run build`.
5. Test website and WhatsApp conversations in every supported language.
6. Test one owner answer and approval in staging; confirm only the approved version is retrieved.
7. Deploy the application and confirm the scheduled retention job is enabled.

## Rollback

The feature fails safely when Grok is disabled or unavailable. For an application-only rollback, deploy the previous revision; the additive tables/columns can remain without affecting old code.

For a database rollback during a maintenance window:

1. stop Knowledge Builder writes and retain a database backup;
2. archive newly approved owner entries instead of deleting them when an audit trail is required;
3. drop `approve_knowledge_builder_question` and `cleanup_assistant_knowledge_retention`;
4. drop the Knowledge Builder/search triggers and helper function;
5. drop `assistant_provider_events`, `assistant_knowledge_gaps` and `knowledge_builder_questions` in that dependency order;
6. optionally remove only the columns added by this migration from the three knowledge tables after confirming no newer application uses them;
7. restore the previous application and run its smoke tests.

Avoid destructive rollback in production unless the additive schema itself is causing a problem; leaving unused tables is safer and preserves owner answers and auditability.

## Verification

Run:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run check:i18n
npm run build
git diff --check
```

The tests cover all supported languages, short greetings, natural/explicit language changes, spelling correction, rephrased retrieval, contextual suggestions, policy-versus-incident handoff, genuine operational escalation, unsupported guarantees/fees/legal advice, privacy redaction, knowledge-gap clustering, protected approval/versioning SQL and Grok-disabled behavior.

## First owner interview batch

The migration seeds ten blocking questions in this order: pricing above 250 m²; window-cleaning inclusion; first paid cleaning scope; subscription pause rules; physical-key fee; digital-lock models and €200 scope; cancellation notice/fees; refund eligibility/timing; exact city boundaries; and human-support hours/SLA. Answer these in Admin → Automated Assistant → Knowledge Builder, then have each normalized answer reviewed and approved.
