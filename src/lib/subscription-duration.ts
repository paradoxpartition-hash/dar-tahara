 * discount in pricing.ts: how long the customer commits to (3/6/9/12 months),
 * as opposed to how often they clean. Applied after the frequency discount,
 * before the existing annual-billing prepay discount in assessment.ts (which
 * still stacks on top when billingInterval === "annual").
 *
 * Pure, no Supabase dependency, see subscription-duration-config.ts for the
 * DB-backed admin configuration, kept in a separate file so this one stays
 * directly unit-testable (same split as pricing.ts vs. feature-flags.ts).

 * For DISCLOSURE, `priceBeforeDurationDiscountCents` is NOT this tier's raw
 * input price, it's reverse-derived from this tier's OWN final price using
 * this tier's OWN percentage (`tierPrice / (1 − tier.discountPercentage)`).
 * This value is mathematically constant across every tier (it always equals
 * `frequencyAdjustedMonthlyPrice / (1 − anchorTier.discountPercentage)`,
 * independent of which tier you ask), so every tier's "before" figure is the
 * same number, the 0%-discount price, and `durationDiscountAmountCents`
 * (the gap between that and the tier's real price) is therefore always ≥ 0,
 * a genuine discount at every tier, never negative/a surcharge.
 *
 * Rounds only once, at the final tier price, never on an intermediate
 * value, so the anchor tier's own price always comes back out exactly equal
 * to the input with zero rounding drift.
