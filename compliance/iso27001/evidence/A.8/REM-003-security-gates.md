# REM-003 security-gate evidence

Date: 2026-08-21

Status: **Implemented in the worktree; repository activation and enforcement pending**

Controls: A.5.17, A.5.21, A.8.8, A.8.12, A.8.25, A.8.29, A.8.32

Risks: R-001, R-002, R-013

## Implemented definitions

- `.github/workflows/security.yml` runs production and full dependency audits, type-checking, linting, tests, a production build, current-tree secret detection, full-history Gitleaks, pull-request dependency review, and CodeQL.
- Third-party and GitHub-maintained actions are pinned to immutable commit SHAs.
- `.github/dependabot.yml` schedules weekly npm and GitHub Actions updates and groups compatible minor/patch changes.
- `scripts/scan-secrets.ts` scans tracked and non-ignored untracked files up to 2 MiB. It reports only file, line and detector name; suspected values are suppressed.
- `src/lib/security/secret-scan.test.ts` verifies representative detection, line reporting, placeholder handling and value suppression.

## Local verification

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `actionlint` 1.7.12 | Workflow passed |
| YAML parse | Workflow and Dependabot definitions passed |
| `npm run security:secrets` | Passed for 814 repository files |
| `npm run security:audit:production` | Passed: 0 vulnerabilities |
| `npm run security:audit` | Passed: 0 vulnerabilities |
| `npm test` | Passed: 664/664 tests, including 3 secret-detector tests |
| `npm run typecheck` | Passed |
| `npm run lint` | Passed; existing ESLintRC deprecation warning only |
| Clean CI-style `npm ci` and `npm run build` | Passed without ignored `.env.local` files; 163 static pages generated |

## Residual work and boundary

The workflow has not run on a repository host and is not yet a required merge check. Gitleaks full-history execution, CodeQL result ingestion, dependency-review behavior, Dependabot operation, alert routing, and test-secret rejection therefore remain operationally unverified. GitHub secret scanning, push protection and Dependabot security updates remain settings-level actions. Activate these only after REM-002 identifies the authoritative repository and management approves branch/release governance. No production or repository setting was changed by this work.

## Hosted verification update

GitHub pull request 65 executed the workflow on 2026-08-21. The quality/dependency job and both CodeQL checks passed. Gitleaks detected a documented false positive in continuity-planning prose; its exact historical fingerprint is recorded in `.gitleaksignore`, and the prose was clarified to avoid future matches. GitHub dependency alerts were enabled through the repository API after Dependency Review reported that the dependency graph prerequisite was disabled. A green rerun remains required before merge.
