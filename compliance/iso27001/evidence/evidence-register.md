## Evidence gaps

All controls still require sustained operating evidence before certification.
Highest-priority remaining evidence: live RLS/privilege export, independent
repository reviewer, privileged-user/factor inventory and MFA recovery proof,
host/container scan, off-site backup restoration record, protected log retention,
alert-to-incident test, incident exercise, supplier contracts/DPA records,
employee lifecycle evidence, physical/property-access drill, approved policies,
internal audit and management review minutes.
