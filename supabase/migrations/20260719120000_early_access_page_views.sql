-- Cookieless, server-side page-view counter for /[locale]/early-access.
--
-- Why this exists: the tracked links produced by the campaign-sources admin
-- utility tell us what we SENT, but nothing about what arrived. Counting views
-- closes that loop (views → submissions per source) without a single analytics
-- cookie, so the counter runs before — and independently of — any cookie
-- consent decision.
--
-- Privacy posture. A row records only:
--   • when the view happened (timestamp),
--   • which locale was rendered,
--   • the campaign params that were already in the URL (src + utm_*),
--   • a SALTED SHA-256 hash of the client IP, truncated to 128 bits.
-- No raw IP, no user agent, no referrer, no cookie, no identifier that could be
-- joined back to a person. The IP hash exists purely so "views" can be reported
-- alongside "unique-ish visitors" — coarse dedupe, not identity. It is salted
-- with RATE_LIMIT_SECRET (see src/lib/early-access/request-meta.ts), so the
-- stored value is not reversible with a rainbow table of the IPv4 space.
--
-- Security model matches the other early-access tables: RLS on, forced, and NO
-- anon/authenticated policies. Writes happen exclusively from the Next.js server
-- with the service role (which bypasses RLS); the browser never touches this
-- table through the Data API.

-- ── Aggregate view ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Pre-aggregated per source_code so the admin utility never has to pull raw view
-- rows. `unique_visitors` is the coarse dedupe: distinct IP hashes, which
-- collapses one person refreshing the page but deliberately also collapses
-- several people behind one NAT. It is an estimate and is labelled as such in
-- the UI. security_invoker keeps the view bound by the caller's own privileges
-- rather than the owner's, so it cannot become a back door around the RLS below.
